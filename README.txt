--Auto watering system --
The goal of this project is to monitor the humidity of plants with the FC-28 Soil humidity sensor,
and applying water whenever the humidity reaches a certain level.

The sensor will be connected to a microcontroller(Arduino). The microcontroller will control
a water pump and add water when the humidity is low.
