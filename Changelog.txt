#AUTO WATERING SYSTEM#
******CHANGELOG*******
V 0.1
Added code for reading the load cell.
The code doesn't start the relays unless the loadcellvalue is over a
certain level.
Reading humidity sensors with analog pins instead of digital pins.
Added code for reading load cell.
Doesn't start relay unless loadcell has certain value.
Prints messages to LCD.
Reads humidity sensors with analog pins instead of digital pins.

V 0.09
Activate humidity sensor from DO-port on microcontroller
Call readSensor with sensor number

V.0.08
Added pins for 3 sensors and 3 relays.
TimeDelay can now be given any number.
//Ex. timeDelay(2); for 2 hours

V.0.07
Relay will now only be activated for a short period
Added time delay loop
Sensor readings are taken every 10 seconds.

V.0.06
Added the relay to the circuit.
The relay will start if humidity is low.

V.0.05
Humidity detection now works properly
Outputs "low humidity" or "high humidity"
along with the sensor state in the serial monitor.

V.0.02
Added serial communication for debugging

V.0.01
Initial version
